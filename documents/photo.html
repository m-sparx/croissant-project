            Known in France as croissants de boulanger, this yeasted dough is
            layered with butter and given a succession of folds that create the
            distinctive profile of classic croissants. Light and airy and
            shatteringly crisp, with a deeply caramelized buttery flavor.

      <h2 class="mt-3 text-center">The History of the Croissant</h2>

      <div class="history">
        <p>
          As recently as the 19th century, the French viewed the croissant as a
          foreign novelty, sold only in special Viennese bakeries in the pricier
          parts of Paris.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts do agree that the croissant was inspired by the Austrian
          kipfel, a crescent-shaped baked good featuring a generous amount of
          butter or lard and sometimes sugar and almonds. According to popular
          lore, the kipfel originated in 1683 as a comestible celebration of
          Austrian victory over the Ottomans at the siege of Vienna. The story
          follows that a baker, up early to make bread, saved the city when he
          heard the Turks tunneling underneath the city and sounded an alarm.
          The kipfel’s curved shape, said to mimic the crescent moon of the
          Ottoman flag, then would seem to pay poetic tribute to the indomitable
          spirit of a city that resisted a powerful invading force.
          (Conveniently, another legend holds that the cappuccino was invented
          almost simultaneously, inspired by the strong Turkish coffee gained in
          the spoils of war.)
        </p>
        <p>
          “The croissant began as the Austrian kipfel but became French the
          moment people began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French
          innovation,” says Chevallier. “It has fully taken root in its adopted
          land.” Order a kipfel in Austria or Germany today and you’ll likely be
          handed a crescent-shaped cookie.
