            Known in France as croissants de boulanger, this yeasted dough is
            layered with butter and given a succession of folds that create the
            distinctive profile of classic croissants. Light and airy and
            shatteringly crisp, with a deeply caramelized buttery flavor.

        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>
            As recently as the 19th century, the French viewed the croissant as
            a foreign novelty, sold only in special Viennese bakeries in the
            pricier parts of Paris.
          </p>

            Experts do agree that the croissant was inspired by the Austrian
            kipfel, a crescent-shaped baked good featuring a generous amount of
            butter or lard and sometimes sugar and almonds. According to popular
            lore, the kipfel originated in 1683 as a comestible celebration of
            Austrian victory over the Ottomans at the siege of Vienna. The story
            follows that a baker, up early to make bread, saved the city when he
            heard the Turks tunneling underneath the city and sounded an alarm.
            The kipfel‚Äôs curved shape, said to mimic the crescent moon of the
            Ottoman flag, then would seem to pay poetic tribute to the
            indomitable spirit of a city that resisted a powerful invading
            force. (Conveniently, another legend holds that the cappuccino was
            invented almost simultaneously, inspired by the strong Turkish
            coffee gained in the spoils of war.)

            ‚ÄúThe croissant began as the Austrian kipfel but became French the
            moment people began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French
            innovation,‚Äù says Chevallier. ‚ÄúIt has fully taken root in its
            adopted land.‚Äù Order a kipfel in Austria or Germany today and you‚Äôll
            likely be handed a crescent-shaped cookie.
